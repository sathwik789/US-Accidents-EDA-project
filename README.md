ðŸš— US Accidents (2016â€“2023) - Exploratory Data Analysis
This project presents an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the US Accidents dataset (2016â€“2023), which contains over 7.7 million traffic accident records from across the United States. The main objective of this project is to uncover meaningful trends, patterns, and 7 actionable insights that can help in understanding accident causes, high-risk conditions, and strategies for safer roads.

Using Python and popular data analysis libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project explores various dimensions of the dataset including time, location, weather conditions, and severity levels.

ðŸ“Š Key Highlights:
Cleaned and preprocessed a massive real-world dataset.

Performed univariate and multivariate analysis to study factors contributing to accidents.

Created insightful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

Discovered 7 actionable insights to aid city planners, traffic authorities, and policymakers.

ðŸ“‚ About the Dataset
ðŸ“„ Description
This is a countrywide car accident dataset that spans 49 states in the USA, with data collected between February 2016 and March 2023. The dataset is one of the largest open-source resources for traffic incidents in the United States.

Accident records were gathered through multiple streaming APIs that provide real-time data captured by various sources, including:

U.S. and State Departments of Transportation (DOTs)

Law enforcement agencies

Traffic cameras

Roadside traffic sensors

The dataset currently includes approximately 7.7 million accident records, making it an excellent foundation for both exploratory and predictive analysis.
